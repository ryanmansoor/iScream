# iScream
School project that I started working on in 2015.
These snippets of code show how I created a linked list containing the Flavours sold by an ice cream store.
It has some code creating a GUI, tables and writing to PDFs. The remainder of the unuploaded code contains similar lists and tables
for customers, workers, stores and some classes that bring them together in a GUI.
Significant achievements from this project: Using linked lists and the Swing GUI.
